## Modules from Retired Projects

Found here are a handful of modules from retired, private projects of mine. They may be of use to you. There will be some helpers methods and database items that are missing, but for the most part these should be easy to work out.

- img_utils.py - use SIFT to determine if a screenshot contains a known brand logo.  
- web_utils.py - fetch page source and screenshots of sites, and check for brand data and logos.
